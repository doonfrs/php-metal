use Metal\Html\htmlPage;
use Metal\Html\div;
use Metal\Html\head;
use Metal\Metal;

$html = Metal::render(htmlPage(
    head: head(title: 'My Web Page'),
    body: div('Hello, World!')
));

echo $html;
// Output:

use function Metal\Html\div;
use function Metal\Html\head;
use function Metal\Html\hr;
use function Metal\Html\htmlPage;
use function Metal\Html\span;

$html = Metal::render(htmlPage(
    head: head(title: 'Advanced Example'),
    body: div(
        [
            a(href: '#', content: span('Click Me!')),
            hr(),
            div('Some additional content.'),
        ]
    )
));

echo $html;
// Output:
